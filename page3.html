  <center><h3>DOGO</h3></center>
  <p> DOGO robot is an innovative tactical combat robot, armed with a 9 mm Glock pistol, created to serve as a watchdog for soldiers in the war field. Designed by General Robotics, this robot is the earthbound equivalent of the ubiquitous combat drone. The most interesting thing about DOGO is it weighs roughly 26 pounds and can be carried in one hand by a fully armed commando. Reportedly, DOGO was designed with input from the Israeli police’s counterterror unit and the Defense Ministry’s research and development directorate to combat terrorism.  </p>

  <center><h3>Guardbot</h3></center>
  <p>Guardbot is an amphibious, surveillance robot that can roll on any terrain, including snow, sand, and dirt. Along with maneuvering on any terrain, this surveillance robot can even swim. Originally designed for missions to Mars, Guardbot is equipped with two surveillance cameras, a battery that can last for 25 hours, microphones and GPS, which allows it to be controlled via satellites as well as remotely. Its smaller version can help search underneath vehicles at security checkpoints. </p>

  <center><h3> Da Vinci Surgical Robot</h3></center>
  <p> It is unthinkable, but true: More than 250,000 people die in the U.S. each year from medical errors, some of which are likely preventable.1 While this is a broad category encompassing a range of different problems, it's certainly true that the more control surgeons have in their operations, the better. The da Vinci Surgical System, a multi-armed wonderbot, is being used to reduce surgical errors and make surgery less invasive for thousands of patients.</p>

<p>The da Vinci Surgical System gives surgeons more precise control for a range of procedures. Using magnified 3D high-definition vision and controls that strap to a surgeon's wrists and hands, the da Vinci System makes tiny, exact incisions that human hands might not otherwise be able to make. This offers enhanced control to surgeons and, since the surgery is less invasive than traditional surgery, a faster healing time for patients.</p></center>

    <center><h3>Boston Dynamic's Spot</h3></center>
  <p>In recent years, MIT spin-off Boston Dynamics has picked up the mantle of the robot development company with the biggest 'wow' factor. In June of 2020, the Massachusetts-based company made its autonomous robot dog 'Spot' available to US buyers for $74,000.</p>
    <p>Spot can climb any stairs that meet US building standards and move forward at a maximum 1.6 meters per second. He weighs about 72lb and comes with a customizable payload port and a software development kit. He can also be augmented with a range of accessories including LIDAR and an Enhanced Autonomy Package capable of extending the robot's autonomous mapping range from 4 to 100 meters.</p>
